# Outlier-detection-using-unsupervised-ML
- Anomaly Detection using Unsupervised Machine Learning
- Using PCA

1.Goal:-

In this challenge, we will use Multivariate and Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm, Isolation
Forest, for detecting outliers in our unlabelled data. Moreover, we will combine Isolation Forest
with PCA technique for reducing the dimension of our data while keeping as much as possible
information and for visualizing outliers in 2D and in 3D.
Itâ€™s known that most outlier detection systems are effective in 99% cases. For the remaining
cases the model either inaccurately labels the observation as outlier while it is not an outlier (False
Positive) and in other cases the model inaccurately labels the observation as not an outlier while
it is actually an outlier (False Negative). Which of these two type of mistakes is more dangerous
depends on the use-case and what are the consequences of making these mistakes. For example in
Fraud Detection high FP might significantly affect the customer satisfaction hence one might want
to use more complex techniques such as Deep Learning techniques (RNN with LSTMs) to avoid
making many FP
